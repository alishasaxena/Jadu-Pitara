      Let’s consider improvements as a journey from Point A to B towards
      achieving a larger goal. The micro-improvement approach helps break down
      this journey towards a larger goal into a series of steps. Each of these
      steps represents one micro-improvement that has its own objective, is
      short, easy to accomplish and the change (success) is visible. The
      frequent wins experienced after every action in the process eventually
      feed into a  continuous cycle of improvement, making the improvement
      journey simple and doable.
